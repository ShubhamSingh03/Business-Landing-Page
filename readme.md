## Description

This project [Business Landing Page](https://businesss-homepage.netlify.app/) was built using Semantic HTML and CSS from scratch.

This project helped me in learning brushing up concepts like **grid**, **transform**, **make mega-menu footer**, **pseudo classes :nth-child** and etc. The Project was completed under guidance of [Hitesh Choudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary), CTO Ineuron
